# Fitness App
This repo contains app that has ability to sign up user for fitness class.


Many of us attending to gym classes propably know the pain when trying to sign up for our favourite class and realize that its full booked.:disappointed: To help prevent this kind of situations a good solution is auto signup application. 

##### Pros of this solution:
* there is no pain if you forgot to sign up to your favourite class
* 

##### Cons:
* works for just for gym that is designed for (after small changes it could work for your gym)
* this type of scripts with auto loggin and signup functions could be unwated
* due to the nature of app it generates real costs working deployed

#### How it works.
1. Registration and creation of user profile (choice of gym and classes)
2. The app will search at appropriate intervals if it can register the user for classes
3. After registration, the user recievs a confirmation via :iphone:
4. If the user will not accept the confirmation from the application, the place in the classes will be unbooked 4 hours before the start.
